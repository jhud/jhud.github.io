			<p>In my view, technology has advanced to the point where its capabilities are almost limitless. As such, most restrictions are no longer technical in nature, but organizational. That means that nurturing and maintaining a positive, harmonious, and high-performing team is more important than the technology itself. We're all experts in our own fields; the development process should be about clearing the way for each other to do our best work.</p>
			
			<p>From a technical perspective, building software feels like building an intricate physical machine. It should be composed of interchangeable modules, which can be improved and fixed individually without changing or knowing the entire system. This approach also suits business needs; new features can be immediately set to work, instead of waiting for some future dependencies to be ready.</p>
