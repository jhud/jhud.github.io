				        	<div class="h2">My Software Development Work</div>
				        		<img src = "images/workpic.jpg" style="float:right; margin:8px;">
								I've been building software for about as long as I have been talking; for big multinationals, small companies, and individuals. Whether it's setting up a company's architecture, or jumping in to provide extra development muscle at short notice, I've seen and done it all in the last 15 years. I also enjoy helping non-technical people to realise their dreams, whatever their field of expertise is. So please email me if you have any software-related questions. 
								<p>
								New technology opens up new opportunities every day; billion-dollar companies can now be run
								by a handful of people. A small, talented, specialist team can often outperform a large, traditional organization.<p>
								The world is filled with frustrating amounts of inefficiency and bureaucracy. Yet, in my experience, the latest technology can 
								roughly double software productivity every year. This can also work for your business, in ways you might not have considered. By riding the wave of technological advancement, life can be made easier, happier, less
								expensive, and simpler, with surprisingly little effort.  My customer's dreams are regularly manifested in a day; or for the really ambitious ones, a week.<p>
								To keep myself, and my customers, competitive, I work across a spectrum of technologies. 
								I do everything from robotics, to multimedia performance, to backend development. I've built services and operating system components used by millions of people. However, I tend to
								specialise in graphics and multimedia.
								<h4>Let's write a proposal together!</h4>
								If your expertise
								is in something other than software, I'll work with you to select
								the right technology and design for your project and budget. I
								can also help with the technical aspects of your
								sales and marketing. Your "specifications" can be as little as 
								the expression of a desire to "make something cool".
								<h4>How I help you</h4>
								You know your own business well, so I listen and learn in
														order to create something that helps you to do what you do, better. I think projects should be undertaken with as little waste
								of time and resources as possible, with stress-free customers and
								a great final creation as the goal throughout. 
								<h4>My engineering philosophy</h4>
		The major problems which remain in software development are not technical, but organisational and social. A great product is made by considering the needs of the customer, the end users, and the developers who will maintain the project in the future. Even the best-programmed piece of software in the world would still be a failure if it didn't serve the needs of those who used it and paid for it.
		<p>
			A well-engineered product, whether it is a piece of software, a mechanical device, or anything else, is one which can be clearly broken down into its individual parts. Changes in one module should not require changes in others.
								<p>
								I'm on
								<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-hudson/3/470/24a">LinkedIn</a>,
								and if you have a support question about one of my products or
								want to contact me, you can use the email

								<H3>Emerging Technology Consultancy ("Industry 4.0": e-Health, sustainable business, and IoT)</H3>
								One of the grounds for optimism in these turbulent times, is the coalescing of various technologies into the basis of a new, more sustainable, economy. This will be a huge growth area in the forseeable future; I'm recommending all my customers to become acquainted with this field.<p>
								
								Interconnected, powerful, inexpensive, wireless devices have the potential to reduce environmental costs, and manage smarter distribution of resources, on a massive scale.<p>

									There has been an even greater parallel explosion in the potential of personal devices for healthcare, but these possibilities have barely been explored. I'm consulting with companies in the healthcare industry, to use emerging technologies to improve everyone's health.<br>
