	<p>I think the world has enough e-scooter, ad-selling, and food delivery conglomerates. I've stayed as a freelance developer because I want independent, imaginative, and worthwhile projects to be able to access the same development resources as large tech companies.</p>
	<p>For new projects, I typically develop products and services from the concept to public release, and advise on technical matters. This could be as small as a simple app, or an entire commercial service.</p>
	<p>For existing projects, I can use my broad experience to jump into a team at short notice, to provide additional development muscle or specialised expertise.</p>
	<p>I can also audit and review existing software, and give technical interviews for potential team members.</p>
	<p>I don't work with recruiters; you can talk with me directly.</p>

	<div id="mission_statement" class="section">
			<div class="section_header">Engineering approach</div>
			<p>I build software with interchangeable modules which can be improved and fixed without changing the entire system by prioritising the development of features in manageable chunks to reduce time and resource usage.</p>

			<p>In valuing communication skills and teamwork as much as the technical, I delivery quality software to suit your company’s unique needs in a dynamic, ever-changing technological landscape.</p>

			<p>In my view, technology has advanced to the point where its capabilities are almost limitless. As such, the obstacles that remain are no longer solely technical in nature, but instead center on maintaining positive business relationships. Building and maintaining a high-performing team is a greater priority than the technology itself, and I am committed to fostering a comfortable, positive, and productive business environment.</p>
