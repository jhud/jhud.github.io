			project. In collaboration with James, we have built a software service
			which is being used to hold events, workshops, and conferences around
			the world. James has delivered a solid product, and solves the
			technical challenges of the project quickly and reliably. More
			importantly, he takes time to understand my vision for WJ-S, and makes
			sure that his technical efforts serve the project in the best way
			possible."</p>

				and web projects. When a difficult problem comes up, he is
				able to draw on a range of skills from his experience on
				many very different projects. I explain what we need, and

				software, high degree of professionalism, and strong work
				ethic makes him stand out."</p>
