		        		As much as possible, I avoid recording any data about you.
		        		The app itself does not "phone home" - it is fully contained on your device
		        		and does not contact any outside servers.
		        		<p>
		        		When you use the sharing features, the app makes a connection to the social
		        		networks you have configured on your phone. The Facebook timeline sharing feature
		        		requires extra permissions, for which you will be prompted. You can cancel these
		        		permissions at any time through your Facebook account.
		        		<p>
		        		The only thing Postcard Creator will use these extra permissions for is to
		        		post photos to a friend's timeline, only when you choose to do so. It will only attempt
		        		to access Facebook while you are running the app, and all the data stays on the app
		        		only for that session, and is not sent anywhere else outside of Facebook.
		        		<p>
		        		This privacy policy may change in the future as features are added, so please check back
		        		regularly if you are concerned. Please also check the policies for Facebook and Apple, which also apply to this app.
