								2014.08.14 - Over 160 000 downloads of the handsfree apps! Thank you so much for your support. When you buy my apps, it pays my bills, so I have more time to add new features to hopefully make your life that little bit better!<br>

					Computer vision is tricky to get working. Please, if you have any problems using
					the software, some suggestions for future features, or have found a bug,
					let me know: <img src = "../images/contact_details.png" style="box-shadow: none;"><br>
					I want want to make sure the instructions are clear, that the system works in
					many different situations, and that you find this software
					practical and a joy to use.

					<b>Some websites run slowly and the motion detection is choppy.</b><br>
					If you have an older phone (iPhone 4), some websites might load slowly.
					Rendering webpages and
					vision processing at the same time is very demanding of the hardware, so try and find
					a mobile version of the site if possible. You can also use slower gestures.
					I'll be optimising and improving the algorithms
					as time goes on, so hopefully this will improve. 
					<p>
					<b>The screen keeps bouncing back.</b><br>
					The sensitive region of the camera is shown inside the white square, so
					drag your hand through that, then move it out of view of the camera. The
					action is more circling than a typical scroll gesture.
					<p>
					<b>It doesn't work, or says "too fast".</b><br>
					If the phone is facing at a bright light, it may confuse the
					camera. Try moving the phone or pointing it away from overhead lights.

					<p>
					This software uses the OpenCV library, as used in computer vision and
					robotics research around the world. It captures single frames from the
					phone's camera, and then applies filters to the frame to
					extract meaningful information about movement in the scene. This
					detected motion is then applied to the scroll position of the web browser.<p>
					The phone knows when it is being handled, because small motions of
					the hand cause a change in the phone's acceleration. When the phone is lying still,
					it enables the motion tracking feature.
